# python_dateTime

## What?
A detailed interpretation of python's datetime library, since I have met time calculation problems several times during interview while not doing a good job on it. Some example are also involved.

## Some typical situations
* Given several strings like 'Mon 5 1923' or '1993 MONDAY 11 14:00' (custom format), calculate the time difference between them
* Given a string in custom format, let you find the time of XXX mins/ XXX hours later
